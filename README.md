# Network analysis of email sender and recipient domains

## Proposed idea

Make a network visualization of email sender and recipient domains in the Shell papers. This could be a way to identify clusters within the email correspondence, in addition to a keyword-based clustering approach. 

## Data
The raw data is available on the [FTM repository](https://github.com/ftmnl/asr)

The script used for the basic-pre-processing can be found in the
[asreview-ftm-hackathon/Example-for-data-pre-processing-track](https://github.com/asreview-ftm-hackathon/Example-for-data-pre-processing-track)
repository, and the pre-processed data is copied from this repository.

The pre-processed data can be found in the `data` folder, named `preprocessed_data.xlsx`.
